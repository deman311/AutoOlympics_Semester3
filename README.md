# Object-Oriented Design Course - Third Semester
This is the final project we had to submit as an exam for the course we took in second year. The idea was to create a JavaFx application that will simulate an olympic contest - you can add contestants, teams and sports fields and when clicking 'Play' the application will simulate the winners and display them.

This practice was to experience MVC oriented programing and was the first time we wrote something like this.
